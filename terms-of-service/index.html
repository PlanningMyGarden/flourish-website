FURTHER, FLOURISH AND ALL OWNERS OF THE CONTENT DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENT, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION WHETHER ORAL OR IN WRITING OBTAINED BY YOU FROM FLOURISH SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY ON BEHALF OF FLOURISH. WHILE USING THE SERVICE, YOU MAY HAVE ACCESS TO EXPLICIT CONTENT FILTERING FEATURES, BUT USE OF THESE FEATURES MAY STILL RESULT IN SOME EXPLICIT CONTENT BEING SERVED AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON SUCH FEATURES TO FILTER ALL EXPLICIT CONTENT. THIS SECTION APPLIES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the exclusion and limitations in this section may not apply to you.</p><p><strong>Limitation of liability and time for filing a claim</strong><br>YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICE IS TO UNINSTALL ANY FLOURISH SOFTWARE AND TO STOP USING THE SERVICE. YOU AGREE THAT FLOURISH HAS NO OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THE CONTENT THEREOF MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, AND WHILE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS MAY BE GOVERNED BY SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH SUCH THIRD PARTIES, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AS WITH RESPECT TO FLOURISH, FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTION WITH ANY THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THE CONTENT THEREOF, IS TO UNINSTALL OR STOP USING SUCH THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS.</p><p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL FLOURISH, ITS OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (1) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (2) ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS (WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), IN ALL CASES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, DEVICES, THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS, OR THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER FLOURISH HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; OR (3) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE, THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS, OR THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT MORE THAN THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO FLOURISH DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FIRST CLAIM; OR (B) $30.00.</p><p>For clarification, these Terms and Conditions do not limit Flourish’s liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury to the extent that applicable law would prohibit such a limitation.</p><p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS MUST BE COMMENCED (BY FILING A DEMAND OR FILING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION AS SPECIFIED UNDER THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BELOW) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DATE THE PARTY ASSERTING THE CLAIM FIRST KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW OF THE ACT, OMISSION, OR DEFAULT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM; AND THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD.</p><p><strong>Third-party rights</strong><br>You acknowledge and agree that the owners of the Content and certain distributors (such as app store providers) are intended beneficiaries of these Terms and Conditions and have the right to enforce these Terms and Conditions directly against you. Other than as set out in this section, (1) these Terms and Conditions are not intended to grant rights to anyone except you and Flourish; and (2) in no event shall these Terms and Conditions create any third-party beneficiary rights.</p><p><strong>Indemnification</strong><br>You agree to indemnify and hold Flourish harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of any of these Terms and Conditions (including any additional Flourish terms and conditions incorporated herein); (2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute; (3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Service; and (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.</p><p><strong>Governing law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver</strong><br>These Terms and Conditions and any dispute, claim, and/or controversy that in any way relates to or arises in connection with these Terms and Conditions or your relationship with Flourish as a user of the Service ("Dispute") shall be governed by and construed under the laws of California, U.S.A, excluding any conflict of laws provisions, regardless of your country of origin or where you access the Service, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located within 60 miles of Atascadero, California.</p><p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the parties agree to waive any right to a jury trial.</p><p><strong>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration&nbsp;<br>ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE SERVICE AND SEEKING MONETARY RELIEF SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ACCORDING TO THIS SECTION.</strong></p><p>Subject to the exceptions set forth in the "Exceptions to arbitration" section below, you and Flourish agree that any Dispute between you and Flourish (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms and Conditions) will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration. The arbitrator has the authority to rule on all issues except that a court has exclusive authority to: (1) decide arbitrability, as well as scope, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; (2) decide whether you and Flourish have complied with the pre-arbitration filing requirements (including the requirements described in the "Pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period" section below); (3) enforce the prohibition on class or representative actions; (4) enforce the provisions regarding mass arbitrations; and (5) enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this Arbitration Agreement. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys' fees and costs where allowable under applicable law), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms and Conditions.</p><p><strong>Exceptions to Arbitration</strong><br>You and Flourish both agree that any Dispute relating to any actual or alleged infringement of your or Flourish’s intellectual property rights shall be brought in the federal courts of California and that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of your or Flourish’s rights, at any time, to elect to have an individual action heard in: (1) a U.S. small claims court (so long as the action is litigated exclusively in small claims court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction); or (2) a court of law, in accordance with the jurisdiction and venue described in the "Governing law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver" section above, seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement does not stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p><p><strong>No class or representative proceedings and class action waiver</strong><br>YOU AND FLOURISH AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Flourish agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief) and all appeals have been exhausted or the decision is otherwise final, then the parties agree that such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court only after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.</p><p><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/end-user-agreement/?ref=flourish.garden#pre-arbitration-notice-of-dispute-and-informal-resolution-period"><strong>Pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period</strong></a><br>Prior to initiating any arbitration, the party seeking arbitration (“Claimant”) must first send a written Notice of Claim to the other party (“Respondent”) by email or USPS Certified Mail. This Notice must contain the Claimant’s name, address, and contact information; the identity of counsel (if any); the nature and basis of the claim; and the specific relief sought.&nbsp;</p><p>After a Notice of Claim containing all of the information required above is received, the parties agree to engage in good faith for a period of sixty (60) days in an effort to resolve the Dispute (this time period may be extended by agreement of the parties) ("Informal Resolution Period"). The party receiving the Notice of Claim may request a telephone or video settlement conference during the Informal Resolution Period in an effort to facilitate resolution of the Dispute ("Informal Settlement Conference"). The Informal Settlement Conference, if any, will take place at a mutually agreeable time, which can be after the sixty (60) day Informal Resolution Period if needed to accommodate the parties' schedules. During the Informal Settlement Conference, you and a Flourish representative must both personally participate in a good-faith effort to resolve the Dispute without the need to proceed with arbitration. Any counsel representing the parties also may participate. Personal participation in an Informal Settlement Conference will not be required if both you and Flourish agree in writing.</p><p>The Notice of Claim, Informal Resolution Period, and Informal Settlement Conference are intended to give the parties a meaningful opportunity to resolve Disputes informally. If any aspect of this "Pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period" section has not been met, the parties agree that a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration and, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator shall not accept or administer an arbitration nor demand fees in connection with such an arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party retains the right to raise non-compliance with the requirements of this section and seek appropriate relief in arbitration.</p><p>Any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period will be tolled for any claims and requests for relief set forth in a Notice from the date that either you or Flourish sends the other a fully complete Notice until: (1) thirty (30) days after completion of the Informal Resolution Period, if no Informal Settlement Conference is held; or (2) thirty (30) days after completion of the Informal Settlement Conference if an Informal Settlement Conference is held ("Tolling Period").</p><p>Neither you nor Flourish may commence an arbitration proceeding until after the Tolling Period has ended.</p><p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) according to its <a href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf?ref=flourish.garden"><u>Consumer Arbitration Rules</u></a>, <a href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf?ref=flourish.garden"><u>Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes Through Document Submission</u></a>, <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Fee-Schedule.pdf?ref=flourish.garden"><u>Consumer Fee Schedule</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Supplementary_Rules_MultipleCase_Filings.pdf?ref=flourish.garden"><u>Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings</u></a>(“AAA Rules”), and the provisions of this section. Where they conflict, the provisions of this section shall take precedence over any AAA Rules. If the AAA is unavailable to conduct an arbitration, the parties shall arbitrate through another mutually agreed upon organization or on an ad hoc basis according to the rules in this section. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.</p><p>If twenty-five (25) or more similar Demands for Arbitration are filed against or on behalf of the same party or related parties, and if representation of the parties is consistent or coordinated across the cases, then the AAA’s <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Supplementary_Rules_MultipleCase_Filings.pdf?ref=flourish.garden"><u>Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings</u></a> shall apply. Counsel filing twenty-five (25) or more similar Demands for Arbitration against Flourish must comply with the AAA’s <a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer/multiple-case-filing?ref=flourish.garden"><u>Filing Requirements for Multiple Case Filings</u></a>. There shall be no class or collective arbitration, or joinder of claims, except as provided for in the AAA’s Supplementary.</p><p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Flourish and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to info@planningmygarden.com within 30 days of the day you first access or use the Service.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, either party may apply for and obtain non-monetary, injunctive remedies or urgent relief in court without engaging in any arbitration or informal dispute resolution process.</p><p><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>About These Terms and Conditions</strong></p><p>Under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract. These Terms and Conditions are in no way intended to restrict those rights.</p><p><strong>Changes</strong><br>We may make changes to these Terms and Conditions (including any additional Flourish terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the revised Terms and Conditions on the applicable Service (provided that, for material changes, we will seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other prominent notice within the Service, or other means). Your use of the Service following any changes to these Terms and Conditions will constitute your acceptance of such changes. Subscribers who do not wish to continue using the Service under the updated Terms and Conditions must close their Flourish account prior to their renewal date or thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, whichever occurs first. If Flourish makes any material change to the Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending us a personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out of those changes via email to info@planningmygarden.com. This opt-out notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of when we notify users of the change and include: (1) your name, address, email address associated with your Flourish account, phone number, and Flourish username. Such an opt-out must be sent by you personally from your personal email address, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. The opt-out notice also must include a statement that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether. Even if you opt out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement, you and Flourish agree that any Dispute will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement in effect immediately before any such opt-out.</p><p><strong>Entire agreement</strong><br>These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between Flourish and you concerning the subject matter hereof. In the event that any of the Terms and Conditions are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms and Conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. A waiver by Flourish or you of any provision of these Terms and Conditions or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. Flourish may assign its rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions without condition. These Terms and Conditions will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of Flourish and you, and Flourish’s and your respective successors and permitted assigns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
