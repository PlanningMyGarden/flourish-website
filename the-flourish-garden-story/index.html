        <p><br>The team at <strong>Flourish Garden</strong> believes that anyone —&nbsp;anywhere in the world — should be able to design and plant their own garden spaces. Even if you know nothing about gardening, it can be educational, enjoyable, and rewarding for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the genesis for the Flourish Garden mobile application — the most comprehensive garden design and garden planning app ever created. The idea started with founder Zona Forsyth, a highly-experienced international landscape architect, and co-founder Lesa Jones, a veteran plant specialist. So many people were asking them for garden advice, they decided to do something about it.&nbsp;</p><p>“In the past few years, we have realized that there is a large community of homeowners that want beautiful sustainable gardens but don’t have the budget for design services and contractors,” Forsyth said. “So, we thought maybe it's time for us to give back to the community and share our knowledge in planting design and gardening with those who don’t know where to start, but want to design, create, work and have fun in their own garden space.”</p><p>Forsyth and Jones have joined forces with a world-class tech development team to create Flourish Garden. Where other gardening apps offer some features, they fall short of the complete, end-to-end garden design and planning experience. Our app provides the convenience of a one-stop-shop for all your gardening needs, accessible anywhere in the world, and includes the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Revolutionary 3D garden visualization</li><li>Extensive plant library including photos and detailed planting and care information</li><li>Works for many types of gardens (vegetable, fruit, house plant, edible etc.)</li><li>Climate zones</li><li>Fertilizing guidance</li><li>Subscriber newsletter</li><li>And more!</li></ul><p>We believe that Flourish Garden can be your inspiration for creating beautiful, sustainable gardens, year after year, and season after season.<strong> In December we will launch the first version of the app in the United States and Canada.</strong> At that time we invite you to visit the app stores, give it a try, and see for yourself. </p><p>“We will take you through the A-to-Z of garden design, and beyond,” Forsyth said. “No matter what level of experience you have, we can always learn more.”</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">💡</div><div class="kg-callout-text"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Have A Question?</strong></b> Email Us: info@planningmygarden.com</div></div>
