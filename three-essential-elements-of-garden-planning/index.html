        <blockquote><em>“Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time&nbsp;ago.” ….Warren Buffett&nbsp;</em></blockquote><p>Planning a garden can be very exciting, especially when you are out at the nursery&nbsp; selecting your trees, shrubs and flowers, anticipating the day you can plant your&nbsp; garden and enjoy the space you created.&nbsp;</p><p>But before that day comes, there are three essential elements you should&nbsp;consider when planning your garden space: soil, water and light. I know this&nbsp;sounds boring and homework sucks, but if you put in a little effort, it will be the&nbsp;difference between just another garden in the neighborhood to the best garden&nbsp;it can be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, let’s give it a try! Here are some maybe not-so-exciting, but important basics&nbsp;of soil, water and light.&nbsp;</p><p>To start, you should identify the type of soil you have in your proposed garden.&nbsp; There are many types of soil and numerous combinations thereof, but the most&nbsp; common types found in gardens are Clay, Loam and Sand. Each one of these has&nbsp; different properties and depending on the soil combinations, it can determine&nbsp; what type of plants will be best suited for your space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clay soil </strong>is a type of soil that has fine particles and retains water. Although clay&nbsp; soil is usually high in nutrients, it can be quite dense and can restrict water from&nbsp; passing through the soil, which can be detrimental to the health of many plant&nbsp; species. When water saturates the soil and doesn’t drain properly, and it can&nbsp; basically drown the plant. This is especially true if a particular plant that does not&nbsp; require much water.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Loam soil </strong>is the most desired soil used in gardens. It is a balanced mixture of sand,&nbsp; silt and clay particles, providing good drainage while retaining moisture and&nbsp;nutrients. This type of soil is preferred because it can be used by a wide variety of&nbsp;plants, is easy to work with and is optimal for plant growth and development.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sandy soil </strong>is made up of large particles that allows water to drain quickly. Just as&nbsp;clay soil retains too much water, sandy soil loses water and tends to dry out&nbsp; faster, depleting nutrients necessary for plant survival. However, one advantage&nbsp;to sandy soil is that it warms up quickly in the spring, making it suitable for some&nbsp; plants to get a head start on the growing season. It is also commonly used when&nbsp; mixed with organic matter to help retain water and nutrients.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it is important to know your soil before planting so you can evaluate&nbsp; whether or not you need to amend the soil to meet your plants' drainage and&nbsp; nutritional needs.</p><p><strong>If you are not sure how to evaluate your soil, here are some options you can&nbsp;explore:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Talk to your neighbors. They may have been through this process and can&nbsp;give you some insight.&nbsp;</li><li>Visit your local nursery or garden center. They may have some insight in your&nbsp; area and will also be able to help you choose plants that have a wide range&nbsp;of soil requirements.&nbsp;</li><li>Contact your local Agriculture Department. Many Ag extension offices&nbsp;collect samples and evaluate results.&nbsp;</li><li>Contact your local soil and plant labs. They can assist you in providing soil&nbsp; sample analysis and can give you guidance on amending your soil if needed.</li><li>DIY Soil test kits. There are many online and can provide you with basic&nbsp; information.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Remember to follow guidelines and procedures when submitting soil samples to&nbsp; get the best evaluation results possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Water is next on the list. It is an essential element for every garden and it is&nbsp; important to know the quality and availability in your area.&nbsp;</p><p>Ask yourself, do you know where your water comes from and how much is&nbsp; available for garden use? Is your water supply coming from the city, county or a private well? Do you get enough rainfall each year to sustain your garden? Or do you rely on municipalities to supplement your garden water during the dry&nbsp; seasons?&nbsp;</p><p>These questions are important when choosing types of plants for your garden. For&nbsp; example, I’m originally from Southern California, where water is a precious&nbsp; commodity. At times, we experience extreme drought and are heavily regulated&nbsp; in our water use. With that said, I would choose plant species that can withstand&nbsp; heavy rainfalls, but can also survive in periods of drought and using minimal&nbsp;amounts of water.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are in doubt, you can contact your local water district municipality and they&nbsp; can give you guidelines on water quality, any water restrictions, and availability.&nbsp;</p><p>And just as soil and water are the lifeline for garden survival, light and shade are&nbsp; equally important elements that need to be addressed. It’s important to evaluate&nbsp; your garden area. If your garden is located on the north side of a structure (such&nbsp; as a house or a large tree) this most likely will be the shadiest part of the garden.&nbsp; The south side will be the sunniest, the east will be the coolest morning sun and&nbsp; the west will be the hottest afternoon sun.&nbsp;</p><p>Determining how much light you have in any given part of the garden will help&nbsp; you choose the appropriate plant for a particular part of the garden. If you are in doubt of the position of your garden you can use a compass. You can&nbsp;purchase a compass at any sporting goods store or download one of many&nbsp;mobile apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have determined the elements of soil, water and light, you can begin to&nbsp; design a garden that will best meet your needs and be on your way to creating a&nbsp; sustainable garden that you can enjoy for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, keep in mind, like many things in life, a garden is a long-term investment that should be planned and nourished. Before you can sit in the&nbsp;shade, you must plant seed in the correct spot.&nbsp;</p><p>For more reading about water, soil and sunlight, check out the following links:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><u>https://bhg.com</u> (study your Yard’s Sunlight)&nbsp;</li><li><u>https://savetarrantwater.com</u>&nbsp;</li><li><u>https://ww.rhs.org.uk/soil</u></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Find Us on Social Media:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/flourishgardenapp/" rel="noreferrer">Facebook</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/flourishgardenapp/" rel="noreferrer">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zonaforsyth?ref=flourish.garden" rel="noreferrer">TikTok</a></p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">💡</div><div class="kg-callout-text"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Have A Question?</strong></b>&nbsp;Email Us: info@planningmygarden.com</div></div>
